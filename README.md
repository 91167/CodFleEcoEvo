# Competition from flounder prevents cod population recovery after collapse

Code and data for review purposes only. 

The Atlantic cod (*Gadus morhua*) population in the Baltic Sea has deteriorated after decades of intense fishing, leading to fewer and smaller individuals. After stopping fishing, cod still does not show signs of recovery. One possible factor keeping the cod from recovering is a changed competitive relationship with the flounder species complex (*Platichthys solemdali* and *P.&nbsp;flesus*), following the change in cod body size. Here, we present an eco-evolutionary model that considers cod body size under the selective pressures of fishing, environmental effects (limited to hypoxic effects), and dietary competition with flounder species. The model shows how cod's body size-related dietary change, with strong enough selective pressure, can cause competition from flounder to keep cod in its smaller body size state even after ceasing fishing. The model's predictions are consistent with spatial data from the Baltic Sea, where regions with more flounder have cod with more dissimilar diets to flounder and smaller body sizes. 

Code v1.0. 

The code is included in two separate R-markdown files. 

R/ecoevo.Rmd contains the complete code for running the eco-evolutionary model. Code for generating related figures for different scenarios is also included.

R/empirical_data.Rmd contains the code to load used data from data/, run analyses, and generate the figures included in the manuscript.

Simply open the respective files in RStudio and knit them to render the HTML output. Pre-rendered HTML-files are also included.
